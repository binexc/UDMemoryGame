# UDMemoryGame
_A Udacity nano-degree class Project_

This web app is the second project towards the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

To play the memory game - take the following steps:

1.  When the page is first loaded, you simply begin making your selection.

2.  When you make a selection, an image will appear

3.  You then select another square.
    *   If the second square is a match, the two images will remain visible with a green background.
    *   If the second square is not a match, the a separate square will appear showing you the correct corresponding square.
    *   You'll need to remember where the other square is - because both images will disappear after a short time period.

4.  You will continue to select the pairings until all matches have been found.

5.  When you've matched all 8 pairings, a dialog will appear showing you your time star rating and an option to restart the game

6.  Note that your star rating will decrease by a half star for each 3 selections which is a pairing mismatch.

Finally, in order to play again, simply click the refresh button in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
